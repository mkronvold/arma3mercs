The general idea behind arma3mercenaries is that we are...wait for it...mercenaries! In this scenario, you have been hired by [Constellis Holdings Inc. Security Division](https://constellis.com/) to assist NATO and Syndicate forces with various objectives against CSAT and FIA. CSAT and NATO are utilizing traditional combat tactics, while FIA and Syndicat are utilizing insurgency type tactics. 

This is not an hourly job! You will have to earn your keep, or pack up and go home! There are currently a few ways to generate "credits" or in-game currency. First, by simply killing an opposing faction (CSAT and FIA). Second, by gathering "intel" (dropped documents from dead enemies or interrogating civilians) on the location of insurgent installations (recruitment HQ's, IED factories, etc.) and disabling them. Third, capturing and transporting civilian insurgents (wearing a "Suicide Vest") to Fort MAGA "Enhanced Interrogation" holding pen. Fourth, by completing ALiVE OPCOM tasks.

- Kills = 0 to 5,000 Cr. (random)
- killing "frindlies" = -5000 Cr. 
- Disabling Insurgency Installations = 0 to 5,000 Cr. (random) (multiple "installations" can be found in one structure!)
- Delivering captured civilian insurgents to Fort MAGA =  0 to 5,000 Cr. (random) 
- Completing ALiVE OPCOM tasks = 50,000 Cr. (some "missions" have multiple task payouts!)

If you have a rough start, no worries, Constellis Holdings Inc. does provide some free "you're a scrub" items, such as a rangemaster outfit, a sub-machine gun, a handgun, some ammo, and a quad to travel along with a few other odds and ends.

Now, you know how to make money, next would be knowing what you can do with it. You will notice "Black Market Computers" marked on the map. This is where you can purchase whatever it is that you need. There are more than just weapons on the black market. Vehicles, med supplies, food, HALO drops (group and solo), ALiVE combat support (for limited times), and fortification and logistical supplies.

> **Tip:** _After purchasing items or fortifications, you can retrieve them from the military green huron container located outside near the black market computers' location._

Fortification and logistical supplies are a huge part of being able to set up out on the battlefield without having to constantly return back to the "Lighthouse" or "Fort MAGA". You can buy fortifications such as sandbags, h-barriers, concrete walls, bunkers, etc. You can also buy rearm, repair, and refueling fortifications as well as STATIC WEAPONS.

> **Tip:** _There are 2 ways to move structures once they have been built. One is with the ACE interaction menu, the other is with ALiVE logistics. Alive logistics can be activated and deactivated from the ALiVE menu (default key is the APP key,  If you do not have that key you can map it to any other key once in-game by going to Configure >> Controls >> Configure Addons >> Addon: ALiVE.)._

My best suggestion is to dive in and start to experiment! I look forward to seeing you out on the battlefield!

**TO BE CONTINUED! COME BACK LATER, HOPEFULLY, I WILL HAVE THIS FINISHED BY THEN :)**
